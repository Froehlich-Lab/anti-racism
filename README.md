Material to help be a better human and scientist (non-comprehensive by any means)

Catalyzed by #ShutDownSTEM and #ShutDownAcademia on June 10, 2020 (more information here: https://www.shutdownstem.com/), the Froehlich Lab has started (and will continue) to aggregate readings, other Universities' action plans, and recruitment/retention resources, which we are using to help guide, at the very least, indivudal and lab level action plans.

We hope others find these materials useful. We'll try to keep growing the information over time and welcome information others have found helpful in pushing academia and STEM fields in a more equitable, inclusive, and just direction.

Using this as an open-sourced way to be a part of action and accountability.
